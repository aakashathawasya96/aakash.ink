    <ul>
        <li>I work at <strong>PYOR</strong>, a data and research firm that helps crypto protocols make informed decisions using analytics, dashboards, and governance insights.</li>
        <li>I’ve worked with major crypto ecosystems like <strong>Arbitrum, Avalanche, and EigenLayer</strong>, creating data-driven tools that improve capital efficiency.</li>
        <li>Previously, I built <strong>doodhwala</strong>, a crypto newsletter which distributed daily crypto news to over 15,000 readers. I shut it down because I didn't know how to scale a media company.</li>
        <li>I started in crypto in 2018, but in 2020 switched to do Indian equity markets analysis. It was boring, and DeFi was kicking off so I moved back to crypto in 2021.</li>
        <li>My research interests include <strong>DeFi, MEV, intent-based architectures, modular blockchains, and tokenomics</strong>.</li>
        <li>My investment focus is on <strong>yield products, governance tooling, and data analytics for protocols</strong>.</li>
        <li>Currently exploring <strong>restaking mechanics, decentralized sequencers, and blockchain scalability</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
