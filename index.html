    <!-- Main Content -->
    <p>Hey stranger. ðŸ‘‹</p>

    <p>Thanks for dropping by on my little corner of the internet.</p>

    <p>My name is Aakash. This website has everything about me (well at least the part I'd like people to know me for lol).</p>

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>I work in the crypto industry. Currently, I am working as the head of research at PYOR, a crypto data services company.</p>

    <p>We help crypto businesses and investors build â€“ dashboard, analytics, and research reports. 
    <a href="#" target="_blank">Check it out here</a>.</p>

    <p>Before this, I've done a few things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Co-founded a crypto media company</li>
        <li>Worked as a PM at (now bankrupt) crypto exchange</li>
        <li>Analysed publicly listed Indian stocks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fun stuff? Haha, it is/was better that it sounds. ðŸ« </p>

    <h3>Life</h3>
    <p>I live in Bangalore, India. I spend most of my time working out and learning new movements.</p>

    <p>Right now, I am:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lifting | Trying to get my squat (target:150kg), bench (target:100kg), and deadlift (target:200kg)</li>
        <li>Swimming | Training for a 4km swim in April 2025</li>
        <li>Learning jiu-jitsu | Aiming for that blue belt in 2025</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sounds like a lot? Haha, it really is. ðŸ˜³</p>

    <p>Follow me on <a href="#" target="_blank">Garmin</a> or <a href="#" target="_blank">Whoop</a>.</p>

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I am interested in â€“ writing. Perhaps, the only thing I can do well (like my life depended on it) is write. Writing helps me think clearly. And that's a rare commodity for me haha.</p>

    <p>I've written many things, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An ebook on crypto</li>
        <li>A self-help guide</li>
        <li>Multiple blogs (some on berating gyms, others on buying cycles)</li>
        <li>Book reviews (like <a href="#">this one</a>, <a href="#">this one</a>, and <a href="#">this one</a>)</li>
        <li>Ghostwriting for clients</li>
        <li>Even a review of a brewery</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some of these I was paid for. Others, I paid time to write. Either way, I learnt a lot.</p>

    <p>Diversity or confusion? Haha, you tell me. ðŸ˜…</p>

    <h3>What's next?</h3>
    <p>In the future, I would like to start something of my own in â€“ consumer wellness.</p>

    <p>What does that mean? Well, I don't really know. Not knowing shows my lack of conviction (yes) but I really don't know what it is.</p>

    <p>All I know is â€“ I want to do something in the field of helping people move their bodies in a way that helps them. Something definitely in the fitness industry. But not something as simplistic as a gym or workout studio. Something more â€“ practical, difficult, self-reliant â€“ and overall a net positive for one's longevity.</p>

    <p>This website is a testament to that eventual goal.</p>
